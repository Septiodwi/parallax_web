            <p>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different
                lines
                of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. The term is
                derived
                from Ancient Greek parallaxis, meaning 'alternation'. Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a
                larger
                parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to
                determine
                distances.</p>

        <h2>How parallax work</h2>
        <p>Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex
            cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with
            overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis.
            In
            computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a parallax
            rangefinder
            that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.</p>
